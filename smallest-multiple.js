// 2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

// What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?


//ideas: can increment by 20 and then check if it's divisible by 2-19?
//num as parameter is the highest number in the range we want the end number to be divisible by
